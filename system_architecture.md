# NextWave Web Application - System Architecture

## Overview

The NextWave web application is a comprehensive platform designed to provide advanced document processing, image analysis, and workflow automation capabilities. The system follows a modern microservices architecture with a Flask-based backend API, a React frontend with glass-effect design, and integrated AI capabilities for document processing and image analysis.

## Architecture Components

### 1. Frontend Layer (React.js)
The frontend is built using React.js with modern UI components featuring glassmorphism design principles. Key characteristics include:

- **Component-based architecture** with reusable UI elements
- **Responsive design** supporting desktop and mobile devices
- **Glass-effect styling** using CSS backdrop-filter and transparency
- **Real-time updates** through WebSocket connections for animated flows
- **Progressive Web App (PWA)** capabilities for offline functionality

### 2. Backend API Layer (Flask)
The backend serves as the core processing engine with the following modules:

- **Authentication Service**: JWT-based authentication with role-based access control
- **Document Processing Service**: PDF editing, conversion, and manipulation
- **Image Analysis Service**: AI-powered image description and characteristic extraction
- **Workflow Engine**: Animated flow simulation and process automation
- **File Management Service**: Secure file upload, storage, and retrieval
- **Admin Dashboard API**: Advanced administrative functions and analytics

### 3. Database Layer
The system uses SQLite for development and PostgreSQL for production with the following design principles:

- **Normalized schema** to reduce data redundancy
- **Indexed tables** for optimal query performance
- **Audit trails** for tracking user activities and system changes
- **Backup and recovery** mechanisms for data protection

### 4. AI/ML Integration Layer
Machine learning capabilities are integrated through Python libraries:

- **Computer Vision**: OpenCV and PIL for image processing
- **Natural Language Processing**: NLTK and spaCy for text analysis
- **Document Processing**: PyPDF2, reportlab for PDF manipulation
- **Diagram Generation**: Graphviz and matplotlib for flow visualization

### 5. External Services Integration
The system integrates with various external services:

- **GitHub API**: For repository management and version control
- **Email Services**: SMTP integration for notifications
- **Cloud Storage**: Optional integration with AWS S3 or similar services
- **Monitoring Services**: Application performance monitoring and logging

## Data Flow Architecture

The system follows a request-response pattern with asynchronous processing for heavy operations:

1. **User Request**: Frontend sends HTTP requests to Flask API endpoints
2. **Authentication**: JWT tokens validate user permissions
3. **Processing**: Backend processes requests using appropriate services
4. **Database Operations**: CRUD operations performed on normalized tables
5. **AI Processing**: Machine learning models process documents/images
6. **Response**: Processed data returned to frontend with status updates
7. **Real-time Updates**: WebSocket connections provide live progress updates

## Security Architecture

Security is implemented at multiple layers:

- **Input Validation**: All user inputs sanitized and validated
- **Authentication**: JWT tokens with expiration and refresh mechanisms
- **Authorization**: Role-based access control (RBAC) for different user types
- **Data Encryption**: Sensitive data encrypted at rest and in transit
- **File Security**: Uploaded files scanned and stored securely
- **API Rate Limiting**: Protection against abuse and DDoS attacks

## Scalability Considerations

The architecture is designed for horizontal scaling:

- **Stateless Services**: Backend services maintain no session state
- **Database Optimization**: Proper indexing and query optimization
- **Caching Layer**: Redis integration for frequently accessed data
- **Load Balancing**: Support for multiple backend instances
- **Microservices Ready**: Modular design allows service separation
